# Coding Club 

*Made By Rohit Dasgupta*

This repository is the basis of Competitive Coding Club but may be used by ninjas who want to learn programming with Python in a competitive nature. You will learn to solve problems quickly and efficiently using Python. 

## About the Repository

This repository is where I host all the files the lessons I will be doing.

## About the Lessons

Competitive Coding Club is organized by lessons and activites. Each lesson is split up into two files:
* Templates
* References

The templates are designed to teach ninjas the basics of programming and can be done entirely on their own if a ninja puts enough time and energy. By the end, the code the ninjas produce should look similar to the references. 

## Outside Help:

If you are finding difficulty with any of the curriculum outside of the club, ninjas are heavily encouraged to seek answers. You may find answers by from popular sites:
* StackOverflow: A very popular site that many professional programmers use to ask questions and find answers to common programming problems.
* w3schools: While this site mostly focuses on Web Development, there are very good python references
* Geeks4Geeks: Has many good references for all programming disciplines

The references are also available but I recommend against using them as much as possible.

## Using the Lessons:

You will need a [Repl.it](https://replit.com/signup) and a [Github](https://github.com/) account in order to follow along. Both of these accounts are free and are easy to set up assuming you have an email.

### Opening the lesson:

First open the template file for the lesson you want (i.e lesson-01-template). 

### Using Repl.it to run code:

[Link to Repl.it](https://replit.com/~).

Click Create a new Repl and select python. You can name your file whatever you want as we will use github to organize our code.

Paste the template file you opened earlier and paste it into the code editor. Add your code and click the run button periodically to test your code.

### Organizing our Code

[Create a Github Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) for all these lessons. Name it whatever you want, but make sure it is understandable and makes sense to you i.e. python-programming-lessons

For each lesson, you will [add a new file](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository). Copy and paste your replit with all your comments and code. Make sure to press the commit button at the bottom to save your progress!
